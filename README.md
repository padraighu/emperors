Note: Information that is completely missing from historical sources is **left blank**.

### Year Issues

Since these sources are from ancient texts, there are a certain number of unknown dates. Below are some notes on how `birth`, `death`, `reign.start`, and `reign.end`. were calculated:

* If the date was BCE, the following actions were performed:
    * The year was made positive
    * The year had 1 year subtracted from its absolute value, to make it consistent with [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Years) (e.g. 1AD = 0001, 1BC = 0000, 2BC = 0001, 3BC = 0002, ...).
    * The "notes" column will state BCE date.
    * The code in `emperors.R` was modified to invert the sign of that specific value (e.g. 1AD = 0001, 1BC = 0000, 2BC = -001, 3BC = -002, ...) to complete the process of ISO 8601 compatibility.
* If the *year* of the date was known, but not the *day* or *month*, the start of the year was taken.
* If the *year and month* of the date was known, but not the *day*, the middle of the month was taken (14 for February, 15 for other months).
* If *two dates were given*, due to inconsistencies with ancient sources, then:
    * In the case it was `birth` or `reign.start`, the earlier date was chosen.
    * In the case it was `death` or `reign.end`, the later date was chosen.
* If the *year and one of two possible months* of the date was known, but not the day, the first date of the second month was chosen (middle of the two options).
* If *two adjacent years* of the date was known, but not the *month* or *day*, January 1 of the second year was chosen (middle of the two options).
    
Discrepancies will be listed in the `notes` column.

### Cause of Death Definitions

In the `cause` column, an emperor's *mode of* death probably needs clarifying in some instances:

* **Suicide** in antiquity was generally a political move, and was often committed in instances where there was strong political pressure. This could either be *Voluntary* or *Forced* but won't be noted as such. [[Further Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_antiquity#Ancient_reasons_for_committing_suicide)]
* **Assassination** occurred when a homicide was committed against an emperor *outside* due process law.
* **Execution** occurred when a homicide was committed against an emperor *within* due process of law.
* **Died in Battle** occurred when a homicide was committed against an emperor during battle or as a result of battle.
* **Natural Causes** occurred when an emperor died due to disease, plague, or something internal.

Discrepancies will be listed in the `notes` column.

### Killer Definitions

In the `killer` column, we are concerned with **who** (generally) killed the emperor or **the root cause**, *not mode of* as with `cause`. Some definitions that might need clarification:

* **Other Emperor** The person who committed homicide against an emperor was another emperor, or was a successor.
* If it was **Natural Causes**, usually the disease that killed the emperor will be listed, usually **Plague**, **Fever** or **Heart Failure**. In rare cases, this will be **Lightning** or **Fire**. If the cause is unknown, **Disease** will simply be listed.
* The **Praetorian Guard** was notorious for assassinating emperors, despite their function.

Discrepancies will be listed in the `notes` column.

### Rise Definitions

In the `rise` column, an emporor's rise to power occurred in one of the following situations:

* **Birthright** - Cases in which an emperor's lineage was the determining factor in their control of the Empire, with little conflict.
* **Seized Power** - Cases in which an emporor used violent force, self-proclamation, or clever opportunism to seize the Empire without birthright or appointment.
* **Appointment by X** - Cases in which an emperor was appointed by an **Army**, the **Senate**, an **Emperor**, or **Praetorian Guard**.
* Other rare occurrences include **Election**.

Discrepancies will be listed in the `notes` column.

### Data Augmentation in Forked Version

## New columns added

* `birth.long` - Longitude of birthplace
* `birth.lat` - Latitude of birthplace
* `birth.cty.now` - Modern name of the birth city
* `birth.state.now` - Modern state where the emperor was born

## Typo

Some text data had typos in the original dataset. The forked version corrected them, which were mainly in Emperor names and birth city names.
